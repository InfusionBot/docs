# FAQ - Welcome-Bot

Below are the frequently asked questions to Welcome-Bot

### 1. Why doesn't the bot reply even when I mention it?
Ans: Please check whether the bot has permissions to `View Channels`, `Send Messages` & `Embed Links`. *CHECK THIS IN THE CHANNEL YOU WANT TO USE THE BOT IN.*
Now try again, If it still doesn't work, it's a bug, join the [support server] and report it.

### 2. What is the bot's prefix

The default prefix is set to `w/` so that's what you can use from the start. If You're not sure what prefix is used you can just `@-mention` the bot (`@Welcome-Bot#0914`) and it will tell you what prefix is used. You can set a custom prefix for your server, but the default prefix can always be used.
